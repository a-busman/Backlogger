# Backlogger

This is my simple video game backlog managing app for iOS. I didn't really like the current offerings on iOS, as they seemed kind of
clunky and non-straightforward. I built this using RealmSwift, Alamofire, and the GiantBomb API. This is my first swift iOS app, but
it's going pretty well so far. I took inspiration from Apple Music for some of my design choices as I like the organization of the
app (as of iOS 10...kind of really didn't like it before). I'm not a particularly good swift programmer, as I decided to just pick it
up one day (I'm mostly a firmware guy), so feel free to criticize anything you want.

## Features
* Now playing cards show game box art with an interface that allows you quickly update your progress in games, and see info about them.
* Searches GiantBomb, an ever-updating database of games for filling in all the details about a game.
* Allows for adding your own platforms in case you happen to have some sort of weird hack of a game released unofficially for a platform
(like if you wanted to beat Half-Life on your iPod mini).
* Make playlists so that you can create a list of games you'd like to play in any order you'd like. Make a spooky games list, or
games in a series, it really doesn't matter what you do, just don't not make any. That's sad :(

## Bugs
* Since this is not complete, bugs are tracked in the Issues tab. Feel free to add some.

## Future
* I want to add steam support, and possibly Facebook and Twitter sharing for things like "I just completed this game! Neato!"
* If you want to see any particular features, again, feel free to add some to the Issues tab.
